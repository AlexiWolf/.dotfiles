# Configs

These are my personal dot files.  They are managed using `GNU Stow`.

## Scripts

The configs can be easily managed using the `stow.sh`, `unstow.sh`, and 
`restow.sh` scripts.

- `stow.sh` will store the configs.
- `unstow.sh` will remove the configs.
- `restow.sh` will remove, then store the configs.
